        - janke learning method 
          integrates theory and practice sooner them early and together
            and complements rather than supplements introduction of theory
            write about and study theory in code!
          best of coding-first and algorithm-first
        pg 22. problems with programming first
          theory & strategy late
          wrong idea of cs
        pg 31. functional first
          [taught sooner] most notably recursion, linked data structures, and functions as first-class data objects
  focuses & criteria for exercises
    combat faults of programming-first while still promoting code fluency
    formal manipulations
    self-assessing
    no dependencies
    in professional environment
    process over product
    prof tasks are not novice exercises
    logging


focus on exercises that
  cover csy things
  have smooth and simple exercises
  focus on thoughtless manipulations
  emphasize process over product
  can't be done outside js

ideas
  top runners
    mapping & demapping
      to give meaning to formal manips
      or is it the point that focusing on the process is enough?
      brings in dom and ui
      cant be done in the same way with any other language
    these can be merged
      - can be done in other languages, reject?
      boolean algebra
      solving boolean solutions
      multi-body conditionals
    recursion
  too subjective for this ?
    analyzing performance
    sets and mappings
      unless i can find something about the specs


oldd stuff
  basic 'code literacy' before cs concepts
    - leave this out for fosdem, keep it for whitepaper
    learn code as communication before entering into cs
    cs 100 should be preceded by 'consoliterate coding'
    super simple programming challenges
    focus on reading, logging, and note-taking in code
