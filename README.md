a beginner language should ... (- Guzdial)
1. Connect to what learners know
2. Keep cognitive load low
3. Be honest
4. Be generative and productive
5. Test, donâ€™t trust  

For Guzdial, JS fails on points 1, 2, 4 & 5.  
his observed shortcomings can be overcome with clever ID, leaving a programming language (and great learning environment!) very well-suited to beginner programmings. (preface - these points all address teaching students of ~17+, or younger but dedicated students)
1. While JS's textual format & syntactic features may not be the most beginner friendly, this can be overcome with a solid series of exercises build around click-and-drag, copy-paste, and fill-in-the-blank exercises. This initial hurdle pays off when students can immediately begin programming simple websites, connecting to something fun and practical for sharing projects with a live hosting on gh-pages
2. JS is filled with unnecessary complexity (especially at the beginning in it's primitives and operators).  This can be circumvented by encouraging a subset of JS & providing solid exercises that do not require students to veer out of this subset.  Once students are comfortable working with basic JS scripts, these 'complex' features can be used to study & understand true cs concepts like composition, sets/functions, ... as in 'computation'.  In fact, the flexibility of JS can be used over-and-over again to create self-reporting exercises in ways that are not possible in other languages (exansions, recursion, manipulating boolean equations, ...). One of the clearest examples of this is how JS can be refactored to explain itself with 'expanding'
3. concur
4. JS can be exceptionally generative and productive.  Once students understand how to write self-reporting scripts (effectively turning their script into custom learning & feedback environments), it opens up enormous possibilities for exploring & discussing significant ides in CS (complexity, algorithmic strategy, boolean algebras, proof, sets & mappings) and in STEM (data science with tools like d3 or tensorflow, program core vs ui,... find more?).  The developer console on most browsers is also an incredibly powerful tool for inspecting & understanding programs that can be mastered in an introductory course if correctly scaffolded into the curriculum. Once mastered, it can be used to write 'consoliterate' programs who's source code forms it's own documentation and write-up.  This can be thought of a local jupyter notebook with no depedancies beyond a browser. In short, the flexibilty of JS and the power of standard browser tools can be used to design a course that will have higher cognitive load upfront than a beginner-friendly environment, but will quickly make up for lost time when there is no need to transfer learning to a different professional environment when it is time to move on.  All learning was done in place -> the context was the content!  Console frameworks give students lots of experience reading well-written code & working within existing code, both are skills that can be difficult to teach and awkward to wedge into standard course methods.
5. i've been using JS for a couple years and have not only had great success teaching beginners, but have also used it to teach data science, webvr (example of no-transfer to something cool & applied), & even had students experienced in other programming languages leave meetups having learned something substantial about programming in general and even their own language
